# Password_Generator
HW3 for UNH Coding Bootcamp: Use JavaScript to create an application that takes in parameters and generates a random password based on those parameters.

## Description

With this project, I was given the HTML and CSS for a web app to generate a random password as well as a starter JavaScript file with the code for making the button in the app run the function. (See second commit for the starter code with which I was provided: [Added starter code for the assignment](https://github.com/LivesInRoom29/Password_Generator/commit/4bca5aa01390c260f79f8bde95a25af56f61ec16)).

I wrote the program that would take in certain parameters from the user and output the random password. The user is able choose the length of the password (between 8 and 128, inclusive) and what types of charcters to use (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters).

## Learning Outcomes

* JavaScript
  * Became more familiar with JS **syntax**.
  * Gained experience writing **functions** and using JS **methods**.
  * Gained experience with finding appropriate JS methods to use, such as .join(), .push(), etc.
  * Gained experience in troubleshooting functions and programs using the browser **console**.


## Credits

* The code that I used to generate a random number within a specific range was adapted from a [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-generate-random-number-in-given-range-using-javascript/) article.

* Thanks to the UNH Bootcamp instructor, TAs, and tutors for providing the class with lots of practice using JavaScript.

* Thanks as well to my classmates for sharing their questions in class and during office hours.

* Lastly, as always. thanks to all the wonderful folks who post their questions and answers all over the web - you are life savers!
